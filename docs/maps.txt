GAME MAPS
Overworld maps contain the main game. Actual tiles can be created by a freeware, cross-platform tool called Tiled.
Maps must also contain an information XML, which is what they are referenced by in the engine.

MAP INFORMATION
The map information file contains everything about the map that isn't tiles.
The root tag, <map>, contains these attributes:
id: internal map id
tiles: path to the tiles file

The map file also contains other varieties of tags.

THE <wild> TAG
Contains information about wild pokemon data. Since this feature isn't really done, no documentation is available yet.

THE <object> TAG
Represents an object on the map. All objects have three mandatory attributes:
id: the object's internal ID. Note that this MUST(!!!) be unique across all maps. If it is not, objects with the same ID will share saved data.
type: the object's type as detailed below
pos: the object's position, in tiles, in x,y form

OBJECT TYPES
There are many object types. A brief summary is available here. Please look in the objects/ directory for more detail.

sign: A sign! Displays text.
warp: A warp! Used to connect maps together.
npc: A character in the game.
trainer: A special variety of npc that can be fought.
