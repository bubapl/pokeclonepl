THE SCRIPTING ENGINE
The game includes a scripting engine for events.
Scripts are generally enclosed in script tags and can change the state of objects.

VARIABLES
Scripts can make use of variables, of which there are four types identified by different prefixes:
Period (.): script instance variables, can only be accessed by the script and are destroyed when the script finishes
Colon (:): map instance variables (NOT IMPLEMENTED!), can be accessed by any script in the map, but are destroyed when the player leaves the map
Pound (#): script persistent variables, can only be accessed by the script but are saved with the game and retain the same value between runs of the script
Cash ($): map persistent variables (NOT IMPLEMENTED!), can be accessed by any script on the map and are saved with the game

Note that .foo, :foo, #foo, and $foo refer to four different variables and can have four different values.
